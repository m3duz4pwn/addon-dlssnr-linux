// The color bridge, 5c form: measured white point + invertible curve.
//
// The frame's linear values are first normalised by the measured white point (a smoothed
// log-average luminance the host reads back from the reduction pass), so mid-grey lands where the
// model expects regardless of the game's arbitrary exposure scale, and highlights keep gradation
// instead of being crushed into the top sliver of a fixed Reinhard. The curve itself stays
// Reinhard-on-normalised -- still exactly invertible, and encode/resolve run in the same frame
// with the same constants, so the round trip is lossless by construction.
